### Tppic: Introduction to Database Systems
----

## Introduction

Database are the backbone of modern technology, that helps everything from social media to banks. When i first heard the term "database" i thought it was just a fancy way to store information like digital files. But after completing Unit 1, I have learned its so much more than that. Databases are the backbone behind almost every piece of device we use today. Thsi unit opened my eyes to a new world of databases, and now I am gonna be sharing what I've learned and how it has changed my thoughts.

## Key Takeaways form Unit 1

# What is a Database?
Data - Collection of facts.
Database - A database is an organized collection of
structured information, or data, typically stored
electronically in a computer system.
Database Management System - is a collection of
interrelated data and a set of programs to access those
data.
Database + Database Management System = Database
Systems

# Why Do We Need Databases?
Bfore databese were discovered, the people used file-based systems which was very messy and inefficient. Imagine the workload of the guy who needs to keep track of every single student's records in a pile of Excel sheets and it sounds like a nightmare but notanymore the Databases solves this by keeping data secure,and easy to access.

# The Evolution of Databases
I was suprised to learn how the databases have evolved over time. In the 1960s,Edgar F. Codd introduced the relational model, which changed the whole system by managign data into tables. This way a huge jump form the old system and its foundation still remains the same.

# How Databases Work
Physical level: Where the data is stored like hard disks.
Logical level: How the data is managed like in tables.
View level: Application layer what the users sees.
These things make the database user friendly.

## What I Learned and Why It Matters

This unit helped me understand databases better. Before this I thought of databases as just a storage systems,but now i seem them as tools that manage data, security and accessibility. For example: learning about the disadvantages of file based systems made me understand the importance of databases.
One of the best parts was the class activity where we discussed how public sectors in Bhuatan could benefit form database systems. This activity showed me how databases can improve efficiency and performance in real life applications.

## Personal Growth and Reflection
Before this unit my knowledge of databases was very limited but now i have a much clearer understanding of databases. One thing that interested me the most was the data abstraction where the idea that databases cna hide the complexity of data storage form user while still being vert useful. It also made me more curious about the techinical aspects of databases, like database languages and engines.

## Conclusion

Unit 1 has been a great introduction to databases systems. It has not only extended my knowledge of databases but also let me know about the roles of databasess in our daily life cycle. From managing finicial reports, databases is everywhere and one must have the certern understanding of it to step in the tech field. As i move on to the next units i am exicted to learn more advanced topics. This is topic has set a striong building blocks and i am looking forward to it.
