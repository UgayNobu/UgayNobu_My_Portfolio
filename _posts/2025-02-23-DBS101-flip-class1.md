### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrators
____

What I Learned During the Flipped Class:
In the flipped class, I learned about the different types of database users and their roles. I now understand how database administrators (DBAs) manage databases by ensuring security, performance, and data integrity. I also gained insights into how developers, analysts, and end users interact with databases for different purposes. The session helped me see the importance of access control, backup management, and overall database maintenance in keeping a system running smoothly.

What I Did During the Flipped Class:
During the class, I reviewed the learning materials beforehand, which made it easier to participate in discussions. We analyzed different database user roles and how they function within a system. I also worked on practical activities, such as identifying security risks and suggesting ways to improve database management. Group discussions and problem-solving exercises helped me apply what I had learned in real-world scenarios.

How the Flipped Class Can Be Improved:
The class was helpful, but it could be even better with more hands-on practice. Watching demonstrations of database management tools or getting guided tutorials would make the concepts clearer. More real-world case studies and interactive tasks, like managing a small database system as a team, could also make learning more engaging. Additionally, having more time for questions and clarifications would help address any confusion.
